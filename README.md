# Installing

## Clone this Project

Just clone it into the folder

## Import the Submodules

Run `git submodule foreach git pull origin master` because it's good for the soul.

If that doesn't work, no worries. `cd` into `modules/extern` and run this command for each folder:

`git submodule update --init {folder-name}`
