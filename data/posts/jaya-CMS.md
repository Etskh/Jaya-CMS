## Layers

It's built on a custom file-based CMS written in only PHP. It uses the directory structure and filenames to determine the names of posts. For example, this text is stored in a file called `hello-world.md` - the filename is then transformed into CamelCase for the title of the post. The date is determined by the modified-time of the file.

## Availabilty

It is available for view on it's GitHub <a href="http://www.github.com/etskh/jaya-cms" target="_blank"_>page</a>.

#### Why the Weird Name?

It's named after my friend's dog. She is the cutest entity in all the galaxy and didn't have anything named ater her yet.
